<div class="box-title">Infinite lines</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To stop MR WACKER expelling ERIC after 10000 lines:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/63931.html">63931</a>,201
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="noLines"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">No lines</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To prevent teachers from giving lines to ERIC or anyone else:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/30464.html">30464</a>,201
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, that won't prevent MR WACKER from giving ERIC 2000 lines during the
'special' playtimes (if EINSTEIN tells WACKER what ERIC's up to, or WACKER
finds the pea-shooter on the fire escape). For that you need:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/63456.html#63468">63468</a>,0
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
One harmless side-effect of this POKE is that the lines total will be printed
as '00' instead of '0' when WACKER delivers his 'TAKE 2000 LINES...' speech.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="someLines"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Some lines</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If 'Infinite lines' or 'No lines' makes things too easy, use a selection of
these POKEs that disable lines-giving for specific infractions:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
CATAPULTS ARE FORBIDDEN - POKE <a href="../asm/62495.html#62545">62545</a>,195
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
DON'T HIT YOUR MATES - POKE <a href="../asm/62628.html#62661">62661</a>,195
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
DON'T SIT ON THE STAIRS - POKE <a href="../asm/30636.html#30698">30698</a>,24
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
DON'T TOUCH BLACKBOARDS - POKE <a href="../asm/62208.html#62366">62366</a>,1
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
GET OFF THE FLOOR - POKE <a href="../asm/30636.html#30758">30758</a>,201
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
GET TO WHERE YOU SHOULD BE/COME ALONG WITH ME BOY/HURRY UP YOU HORROR/DON'T TRY
MY PATIENCE BOY - POKE <a href="../asm/30636.html#30735">30736</a>,0
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
NEVER BE LATE AGAIN/AND STAY THIS TIME - POKE <a href="../asm/62208.html#62249">62249</a>,1
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
NOW DON'T DO IT AGAIN - POKE <a href="../asm/27196.html">27196</a>,201 (after a teacher has been
knocked over)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
NOW DON'T DO IT AGAIN - POKE <a href="../asm/62208.html#62294">62294</a>,1 (when EINSTEIN says 'ERIC hit
me')
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
NOW FIND A SEAT - POKE <a href="../asm/30636.html#30749">30749</a>,201
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
THE ROOM IS PRIVATE - POKE <a href="../asm/30636.html#30716">30717</a>,31 (also suppresses GET TO WHERE YOU
SHOULD BE if ERIC is in the head's study or the staff room when he should be in
class)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
YOU ARE NOT A KANGAROO - POKE <a href="../asm/62771.html#62779">62780</a>,99
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="linesLimit"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Lines limit</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To change the lines limit from 10000 to 10N:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/63931.html#63934">63935</a>,INT(N/256)</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/63931.html#63942">63943</a>,N-256*INT(N/256)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To change the expulsion message MR WACKER delivers (at <a href="../asm/61926.html">61926</a>) accordingly,
you will need to POKE the ASCII codes of the digits of the new lines limit into
addresses 61940-61944.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
For example, to change the lines limit to 20000 and adjust the expulsion
message to match:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE 63935,7: POKE 63943,208: POKE 61940,50
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="silentSnitch"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Silent snitch</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To make sure that EINSTEIN never tells tales:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/62208.html#62270">62270</a>,24: POKE <a href="../asm/62208.html#62321">62321</a>,24
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Alternatively, to make the teacher always give lines to EINSTEIN for telling
tales:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/31968.html#31982">31982</a>,0
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="singleShield"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Single shield</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Hitting all 15 shields before obtaining the safe combination, and then hitting
all 15 shields again after opening the safe can be hard work for a busy
skoolboy. To reduce ERIC's task to hitting just one shield (any shield):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/63668.html#63672">63673</a>,1
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note that in order to go up a year, ERIC will have to hit the same shield as he
hit before opening the safe.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="unsafeCombination"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Unsafe combination</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Having to knock down the teachers (or, in CREAK's case, discover his year of
birth and then write it on the blackboard in the classroom he'll be teaching in
next) in order to obtain the safe combination letters, and then try up to six
permutations of those letters before hitting the right one, can be a tiresome
task. How much easier it would be if BOY WANDER and the teachers took it upon
themselves to reveal the safe combination every time they wrote on a
blackboard:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/29284.html#29312">29313</a>,0</div>
<div>POKE 29315,127</div>
<div>POKE 29322,62</div>
<div>POKE 29323,159</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The teachers and BOY WANDER will actually write the safe combination followed
by WACKER's, ROCKITT's, WITHIT's and CREAK's individual safe combination
letters, in that order, but those last four letters can be ignored.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="lessonLength"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Lesson length</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Normally the lesson clock (at <a href="../asm/32759.html">32759</a>) counts down from 5376 (21*256) to 0, at
which point the bell rings. To make the lesson clock count down from N*256 to 0
instead:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/26342.html">26344</a>,N
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If you are extending the lesson length, it's a good idea to also adjust the
time at which teachers will tell the kids to sit down. Normally this is 3840
(15*256); to change it to M*256 (M=N-6 is a good choice):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/31807.html#31810">31811</a>,M
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If, on the other hand, you are shortening the lesson, it's a good idea to also
adjust the time at which teachers will start giving lines to ERIC for being in
the wrong classroom. Normally this is 4864 (19*256); to change it to G*256
(G=N-2 is a good choice):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/30636.html#30770">30771</a>,G
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="ringBell"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Ring the bell</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To put ERIC in charge of ringing the bell:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/26656.html#26700">26700</a>,123 (points 'L' at <a href="../asm/26656.html#26747">26747</a>)</div>
<div>POKE 26748,230: POKE 26749,102 (sets the keypress-handling routine for 'L'
to <a href="../asm/26342.html">26342</a>)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Now whenever 'L' (upper case) is pressed, the bell will ring and the next
lesson will begin (which could prove handy if ERIC is found playing truant,
cannot be bothered to hide from ANGELFACE when he has mumps, or simply cannot
wait any longer for playtime).
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="alwaysRun"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Always run</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Normally 'q', 'a', 'o' and 'p' make ERIC walk, and 'Q', 'A', 'O' and 'P' make
him run. To make ERIC always run, regardless of whether SHIFT is held down:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/25916.html#25941">25941</a>,24
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Or, to make ERIC walk when SHIFT is held down and run when it isn't:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/25916.html#25941">25941</a>,32
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="superCatty"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Super catapult</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To extend the range of the catapult from 13 to N:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/28744.html#28772">28773</a>,N
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, this doesn't extend the 'hit zone' of the pellet (the portion of its
flight where it can hit something). To change the hit zone from the last 7
stages of its flight to the last M stages (M=N-6 is a good choice):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/27932.html#27999">28000</a>,M+1
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="throughWalls"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Walk through walls</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To enable ERIC to walk through specific walls:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/26194.html#26233">26233</a>,0 (classroom walls, from the right side)</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/26282.html#26328">26328</a>,0 (classroom walls, from the left side)</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/26282.html#26320">26320</a>,0 (wall at the top of the right-hand staircase on the
middle floor)</div>
