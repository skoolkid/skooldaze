<div class="box-title">The importance of little boy no. 11</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In demo mode, ERIC bases his every move on where little boy no. 11 is and what
he's doing (see the routine at <a href="../asm/62938.html">62938</a>). This important role means that little
boy no. 11 is in all of ERIC's classes (if he weren't, ERIC would be guilty of
truancy in demo mode). In fact, little boy no. 11 is the only character besides
EINSTEIN who joins ERIC for every class.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
One consequence of this devotion to little boy no. 11 is that ERIC can
sometimes be seen going from one end of a staircase to the other three times in
succession, as if unsure of where to go. This happens because when little boy
no. 11 starts climbing a staircase, ERIC will run to the top and get there
before him, then run down to the bottom looking for him, and finally run to the
top again to catch up with him.

The tune that plays just before a game (or demo mode) starts, and also when
ERIC goes up a year, is

<div class="box-title">Alternative differences</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The version of Skool Daze that was released by Alternative Software Ltd in 1987
contains three visible differences from the version released by Microsphere in
1984.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(1) MR WITHIT's blackboard message at <a href="../asm/59392.html">59392</a> reads 'WHY IT RAINS IN
MANCHESTER' (which doesn't fit on the blackboard) instead of 'MANCHESTER
MONSOONS'.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(2) The font graphic for the '/' (slash) character is slightly broken:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<table class="">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="alt_slash" src="../../images/font/alt_slash.png" /></td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1">instead of</td>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="slash" src="../../images/font/slash.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(3) In the stampede playtimes (lessons <a href="../lessons/252.html">252</a> and <a href="../lessons/253.html">253</a>), the stampede
leader (little boy no. 1) walks up and down only 7 times instead of 40 while
waiting for his comrades to join him.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note that (1) and (2) appear to be regressions, which suggests that the version
released by Alternative is based on an earlier cut of the code than the version
released by Microsphere.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="slashDot"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Slash dot</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The '\' (backslash) character in the Skool Daze font has a bit missing:

<div class="paragraph">
<table class="">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="backslash_dot" src="../../images/font/backslash_dot.png" /></td>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Interestingly, the corresponding bit is also missing from the '/' (slash)
character in the version of Skool Daze that was released by Alternative
Software in 1987 (see <a href="facts.html#alternativeDifferences">Alternative differences</a>), but it is present in the
original 1984 release by Microsphere.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="onePaceOrThree"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">One pace or three?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If a teacher is conducting a class without ERIC, or is conducting ERIC's class
but has chosen not to engage in a question-and-answer session with EINSTEIN, he
will pace up and down in front of the blackboard (or map). But the number of
paces up and then down depends on the room he's in.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If he's in the White Room, he will take one pace up and then down, oscillating
between x-coordinates 29 and 30. If he's in the Reading Room, he will also take
one pace up and then down, oscillating between x-coordinates 45 and 46. And if
he's in the Map Room, he will once again take one pace up and then down,
oscillating between x-coordinates 61 and 62. But if he's in the Exam Room, he
will take three paces up and then down, oscillating between x-coordinates 44
and 47.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this discrepancy in pace numbers is the method used to calculate
the teacher's next pace-up or pace-down destination, which is to take his
current x-coordinate and do an XOR 3 on it: see the sections of code at
<a href="../asm/32048.html#32115">32115</a> and <a href="../asm/62208.html#62429">62429</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="invulnerableMoments"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Invulnerable moments</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ERIC can usually throw a punch or fire his catapult and be confident that the
impact will send one of the kids or teachers tumbling. However, on certain
occasions, certain characters are invulnerable to ERIC's violence. Those
characters and occasions are as follows:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="">
<li>MR WACKER, when he's looking for ERIC after EINSTEIN has told him what ERIC's up to</li>
<li>MR WACKER, when he's looking for ERIC after finding the pea-shooter on the fire escape</li>
<li>MR WACKER, when he's looking for ERIC to send him home after accumulating 10000 or more lines</li>
<li>MR ROCKITT, when he's looking for ERIC to send him home after catching mumps from ANGELFACE</li>
<li>Little boy no. 10, when he's looking for ERIC to tell him about ANGELFACE, EINSTEIN or BOY WANDER in one of the special playtimes (<a href="../lessons/243.html">243</a>, <a href="../lessons/244.html">244</a>, <a href="../lessons/245.html">245</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason these characters are invulnerable while looking for ERIC is that
they are under the control of the uninterruptible subcommand routine at
<a href="../asm/63374.html#63390">63390</a>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In addition, any boy is invulnerable when he's looking for a seat in a
classroom, because he's under the control of the uninterruptible subcommand
routine at <a href="../asm/27772.html">27772</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="undeliverableMessage"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Undeliverable message</div>
<div class="paragraph">
On those occasions when MR WACKER, MR ROCKITT or little boy no. 10 is looking
for ERIC to deliver a message, ERIC can delay delivery of the message by making
sure that he is writing on a blackboard when the messenger arrives. The
messenger will then wait until ERIC has finished scribbling before commencing
delivery.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To verify this, use the following POKEs (which make every playtime the
'special' playtime in which little boy no. 10 will come looking for ERIC to
tell him that EINSTEIN is going to grass him up to MR WACKER) and then head for
the nearest blackboard:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/28211.html">28212</a>,0</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/28211.html#28213">28214</a>,<a href="../lessons/244.html">244</a></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If you're feeling very patient, you can use this stalling technique to avoid
having to take part in the special playtime: just stand at the blackboard for
about 20 minutes until the bell rings.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Rather more interesting is that you can use this technique to

<div class="paragraph">
The sprite graphic data is split between two base pages: page <a href="../asm/47360.html">185</a>
for the boys and the catapult pellet, and page <a href="../asm/51456.html">201</a> for the teachers
(see <a href="../asm/27914.html">27914</a>). However, the graphic data based in page 185 contains exact

This suggests that the original plan was to have the graphic data for every
character based in page 185, but space ran out while adding MR WACKER's
sprites, so the graphic data for him and the other teachers had to go to page
201.

examination of the tile references used to build these sprites reveals
something interesting:

The numbering of the tiles suggests that the bottom-right tile of animatory

animatory state 209 was originally 209 (not 141). If those changes are
made (POKE 47185,81: POKE 45265,209), the shoe on MR WACKER's back foot takes a
different shape:

So why didn't copies of tiles 81 and 209 from page 185 (which seem to
finish MR WACKER's back foot better than tiles 13 and 141 do) make their
way into page 201? The most likely answer is lack of space: there are no
unused sprite tiles based in page 201, and tiles 13 and 141 are similar
enough to tiles 81 and 209 to make reasonable substitutes.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Points for a punching or a pelleting</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ANGELFACE is unique among the cast of characters in that if ERIC knocks him
over with a punch, 30 points are awarded (see <a href="../asm/62628.html#62656">62656</a>). In addition, if ERIC
knocks him over with a catapult pellet, 10 points are awarded (see <a href="../asm/27932.html#28029">28029</a>). No
points are awarded for knocking anyone else over.

<div><span id="bwShootsEricScores"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">BOY WANDER shoots, ERIC scores</div>
<div class="paragraph">
BOY WANDER may be a tearaway, but sometimes his impulsive nature can be more of
a help than a hindrance. If he lets rip with his catapult and the pellet knocks
ANGELFACE for six, you score 10 points - just as if ERIC had decked the bully
himself. The reason for this is that the section of code at <a href="../asm/27932.html#28025">28025</a> does not
bother to check whose pellet has collided with ANGELFACE's head. (The check for
pellet ownership was added in Back to Skool, though.)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
It's also possible for one of BOY WANDER's pellets to bounce off a teacher's
head, hit a shield, and make it flash - scoring even more points - but that
would be a rare occurrence indeed.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="bullyFriends"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">ANGELFACE's friends</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When ANGELFACE is throwing his fists around in hopes of landing a sweet one on
somebody's jaw, his fist-throwing actions are under the control of the
continual subcommand routine at <a href="../asm/28446.html">28446</a>, which checks whether there are any
potential victims within punching distance. One interesting feature of this
routine is that it neglects to check little boys 8-11. Are these four boys
ANGELFACE's secret best friends, or his most dangerous enemies?
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Though the routine does not check little boys 8-11, if any one of those boys
happens to be within range when ANGELFACE lashes out, he will still go down,
because the routine at <a href="../asm/28569.html">28569</a> does a full check.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To get rid of ANGELFACE's favouritism and make the routine at <a href="../asm/28446.html">28446</a> check all
11 little boys:

<div class="box-title">ANGELFACE's X-ray vision</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When ANGELFACE is in the White Room waiting for the teacher to arrive and ERIC
is in the Exam Room next to and facing the wall, ANGELFACE will throw punches
at the White Room wall, apparently aware that ERIC is behind it, but unaware
that ERIC cannot walk through the wall and meet his fist.

<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="axrv" src="../../images/play_area/axrv.png" /></td>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason this happens is that the routine at <a href="../asm/28416.html">28416</a>, which checks whether
anyone is within punching range, does not take into account the walls between
classrooms.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, ANGELFACE will only perform this trick in the White Room: in the other
classrooms he doesn't get close enough to the wall to be able to 'see' anyone
through it.

<div class="box-title">Seat selection</div>

Typically, when a teacher arrives at the classroom doorway to start the lesson,
the boys will rush to the back seat and sit down. However, if a boy is late for
class in the Map Room or Exam Room - that is, he arrives at the doorway after
the teacher already has - then he will take some other seat (as shown below),
depending on where his command list sends him.

The reason this happens to a latecomer is that he doesn't get a chance to walk
around before having to find a seat and sit down, because the teacher has
already arrived, the corresponding signal has already been raised, and so the
routine at <a href="../asm/25303.html">25303</a> moves straight to the next command in the command list:
<a href="../asm/27808.html">27808</a> (find a seat and sit down). That command makes the boy move forward to
the next seat if he's facing left (which is the case if he's just entered the
Map Room or Exam Room), or walk to the back of the classroom if he's facing
right. When the boy does get a chance to walk around first, he ends up facing
right before that command kicks in, and then keeps moving right to the back of
the class.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note that BOY WANDER always tries to sit in the back seat in the Exam Room,
because after entering that room he goes to the blackboard first, and then
walks to the middle of the room, at which point he is facing right.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This unusual seat selection does not happen in the Reading Room or White Room,
because the boy is facing right when he arrives in the classroom, and so keeps
moving right to the back of the class.

<div class="box-title">The mystery of the unused status flag</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Bit 6 of ERIC's status flags at <a href="../asm/32763.html">32763</a> is unused: it's always 0. However, the
routines at <a href="../asm/25983.html">25983</a> (down), <a href="../asm/26084.html">26084</a> (up) and <a href="../asm/26194.html">26194</a> (left) check the flag and
act on the result.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<a href="../asm/25983.html">25983</a> (down) checks bit 6 early on. If it's set, a jump is made over the code
that checks whether ERIC is on or near a staircase, straight to the code that
moves ERIC left or right (depending on which way he's facing).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<a href="../asm/26084.html">26084</a> (up) does the same, which suggests that bit 6 may once have been set or
reset elsewhere to indicate whether ERIC is on a staircase.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, <a href="../asm/26194.html">26194</a> (left) suggests otherwise. It checks bit 6, and if it's reset,
a jump is made over some code that looks as if it was once used to adjust
ERIC's animatory state in some way: see <a href="../asm/26194.html#26250">26250</a>.

Byte 121 of a character's buffer is unused and always zero. However, the

MSB in byte 121, and if it finds one, copies it to byte 112 (which
otherwise holds the MSB of the address of the uninterruptible subcommand
routine that's currently in use).
</div>

What could this mechanism - which seems to provide for a sort of secondary
uninterruptible subcommand - have been used for while the game was in

<div class="box-title">Pitch imperfect</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When ERIC walks, fires his catapult, throws a punch, is knocked out, or
receives lines, the accompanying sound effects are played with interrupts
enabled, which means they are affected by keys being held down. This is
especially noticeable with the lines-giving sounds, which are somewhat longer
than the others. To make them even longer:

<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/30464.html#30541">30546</a>,0: POKE <a href="../asm/30464.html#30575">30577</a>,0

Now put ERIC up to mischief in front of a teacher, and see if you can detect
the change in pitch of the lines-giving screeches as you hold down various
keys.

During playtime, the teacher most likely to be found pacing up and down in the
staff room is MR CREAK, who spends 23 of the 26 playtimes in the <a href="../asm/65024.html">main
timetable</a> in that room (the three exceptions being those playtimes where the
little boys stampede around the skool). The teacher least likely to be found in
the staff room is MR WACKER, who spends only three playtimes there; the other
23 playtimes he divides between his study (3 times) and walking around the
skool (20).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
BOY WANDER spends most of his playtimes (16 out of 26) in search of clean
blackboards to write on.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ANGELFACE and EINSTEIN spend every playtime wandering around the skool from one
<a href="../asm/27082.html">randomly chosen location</a> to another. The 11 little boys, however,
split their playtimes between wandering around the skool and walking up and
down in one of the four playtime locations (Revision Library, fire escape, gym
and big window) until the bell rings.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The playtime probabilities described here are all subject to alteration by the
fact that, three times out of eight, a playtime in the main timetable is
replaced with a 'special' playtime (<a href="../lessons/243.html">243</a>, <a href="../lessons/244.html">244</a> or <a href="../lessons/245.html">245</a>)
